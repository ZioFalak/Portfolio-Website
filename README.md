# Portfolio Website

This project is a personal portfolio website that showcases my skills, work, and experience. It is hosted locally using **XAMPP** for Apache and MySQL services. The website serves as a platform to introduce myself and my projects to potential employers or collaborators.

## Features
- **Personal Portfolio**: Displays information about myself, my skills, and my work.
- **Projects Showcase**: Highlights key projects and achievements.
- **Contact Information**: Allows visitors to reach out via LinkedIn.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
To run this website locally, you will need:
- **XAMPP**: A free and open-source cross-platform web server solution, which includes:
  - **Apache**: For serving web pages.
  - **MySQL**: If you plan to use a database (optional).

You can download XAMPP from [here](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html).

### Installation
1. After installing XAMPP, move your project files (the entire website folder) to the `htdocs` directory in the XAMPP installation folder.
   - Typically, the path will be something like: `C:\xampp\htdocs\`.
   - Place your website folder in this directory (e.g., `C:\xampp\htdocs\falak-phase2`).

2. Start the Apache server using the XAMPP control panel.

3. Open your web browser and enter the following URL to view your website:
   ```
   http://localhost/falak-phase2
   ```

### Usage
- **To view the website**: After setting it up in XAMPP, you can view it by navigating to `localhost/falak-phase2` in your browser.

This portfolio contains:
- A personal landing page.
- A showcase of my projects, experiences and a blog.
- A point of contact for potential employers or collaborators.

## Dependencies
- **XAMPP**: You need to have XAMPP installed to run Apache and (optionally) MySQL if you're using a database for dynamic content.
